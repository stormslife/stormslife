		<h2>Storm's Evening Swim</h2>
	</div>
	<div class = "main_article">
		<p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Yesterday evening Storm was playing with his pet humans and his brother Ryker. He was having lots of fun when suddenly he got an idea… What if I jump over the fence? Storm immediately went to work. He slunk over to the corner where he planned to climb the fence. There it stood 4 feet of wire and pvc. He began to sniff, nosing his way around the bushes to get a feel of how thick they were. They weren’t. He would have to use just the fence. After further inspection Storm decided he would try. First to throw the humans off he began to play again. Then suddenly he went for it. One second, he was on the wall. Two and he was halfway over, with one more pull he fell down to the other side just as the humans realized he was gone.			<br> 
		<br> 
		<p> 15 minutes go by and Storm is spotted running into the woods.</p>
		<br> 
		<p> Another 10 and he's seen by the edge of the lake. Storm spots a goose… Storm wants dinner. He creeps into the water– just kidding he clumsily trots into the water. Storm proceeds to swim after the goose for 10 or so minutes, barking the whole time. Eventually Storm begins to realize he isn’t catching the goose. Storm’s last hope is the triple bark… he triple barks… nothing happens. So he does it again and again until eventually his pesky owners catch him and make him go inside. Storm never got to eat the goose.</p>
